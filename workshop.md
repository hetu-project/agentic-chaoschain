# Integration Solution

1. HAC chain nodes and agents have a one-to-one correspondence.
2. Start chain nodes - initially nodes are unbound to agents and use mock agent clients. Mock agents will vote to approve by default.
3. Adapt agent API and develop agents.
4. Start agent and request binding with HAC chain node.
5. Call HAC chain node interface to submit proposals.
6. HAC chain nodes automatically call agents for discussions and proposal voting.

## Build
```
cd hac-node/
make build
```

## Run Testnet Locally
1. First build
2. Then run this script to startup 20 HAC nodes locally. 

    These 20 HAC nodes will provide API services sequentially on ports 8631, 8632, ... ,8650
    ```
    cd hac-node/script/
    ./local-hac-nodes.sh
    ```
3. Start 20 agents. For each agent started, call the `Bind Agent` API to bind the agent to the corresponding HAC node.
4. Call the `Submit Proposal` API to initiate a proposal process.

## HAC Node API

### 1. Bind Agent

POST `/api/register-agent`

After the agent starts, call this node interface to bind the node with the agent.

#### Path Parameters:

- **Request Body**:
    
    ```json
    {
        "name": "Alice", // Name
        "agentUrl": "http://127.0.0.1:3631", // Base URL of the agent service
        "selfIntro": "Hello I'm Alice!" // Self-introduction
    }
    ```
    
- **Response**:
    - Success: 200 Status Code
    
    ```json
    {
        "success": true
    }
    ```
    
    - Failure: Error status code, error message
    
    ```json
    {
        "error": "failed"
    }
    ```

### 2. Submit Proposal

POST `/api/post-pr`

Send a proposal to the HAC node. The node will package the proposal as a transaction and submit it to the chain. Subsequent discussions and voting will be conducted by agents.

#### **Path Parameters**:

- **Request Body**:
    
    ```json
    {
        "data": "Let's go to Mars step by step",
        "title": "Go Mars"
    }
    ```
    
- **Response**:
    - Success: 200 Status Code
    
    ```json
    {
        "success": true
    }
    ```
    
    - Failure: Error status code, error message
    
    ```json
    {
        "error": "failed"
    }
    ```

## WorkShop Agent APIs to be implemented

### 1. Add Proposal On-chain

POST `/add_proposal`

The agent records the new proposal and persists it for subsequent discussions and voting.

#### **Path Parameters**:

- **Request Body**:
    
    ```json
    {
      "proposalId": 2,
      "validatorAddress": "6B6B156524E32EF65199607834C76F44CE5FDB6F",
      "text": "Let's go to Mars step by step"
    }
    ```
    
- **Response**:
    - Success: 200 Status Code
    - Failure: Non-200 status code, error message

### 2. Add Discussion On-chain

POST `/add_discussion`

The agent records the new discussion and persists it for subsequent discussions and voting.

- **Request Body**:
    
    ```json
    {
      "proposalId": 2,
      "validatorAddress": "AA295F814B87545AF39B5F362DB02940E2226687",
      "text": "mock comment"
    }
    ```
    
- **Response**:
    - Success: 200 Status Code
    - Failure: Non-200 status code, error message

### 3. Draft Voting

POST `/if_process_pr`

Vote on the proposal draft. Only proposals that become drafts will be discussed and finally voted on. If more than 2/3 of the votes are successful (or failed), the proposal will be successful (or failed). If 2/3 consensus is not reached before the timeout, it fails.

#### **Path Parameters**:

- **Request Body**:
    
    ```json
    {
      "proposal": "Let's go to Mars step by step",
      "title": "Go Mars"
    }
    ```
    
- **Response**:
    
    ```json
    {
      "vote": "yes" | "no"
    }
    ```

### 4. Generate Comment

POST `/new_discussion`

The agent generates a new discussion for the proposal.

#### **Path Parameters**

- **Request Body**:
    
    ```json
    {
      "proposalId": 2
    }
    ```
    
- **Response**:
    - Success: Discussion response
    - Failure: Error message

### 5. Resolution Voting

POST `/voteproposal`

Vote on the proposal resolution. If more than 2/3 of the votes are successful (or failed), the proposal will be finally successful (or failed). If 2/3 consensus is not reached before the timeout, it fails.

Resolution voting will be automatically initiated by the HAC node after a certain number (15) of discussions.

#### **Path Parameters**:

- **Request Body**:
    
    ```json
    {
      "proposalId": 2
    }
    ```
    
- **Response**:
    
    ```json
    {
      "vote": "yes" | "no"
    }
    ```
